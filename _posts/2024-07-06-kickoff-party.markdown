Dear neighbors,

It was great to see so many of you last Saturday for our Peralta/Holladay gathering.

We were thrilled to have over 50 neighbors come out to learn about the effort underway to create the Cesar Chavez Greenway.  Thank you for your enthusiasm to help transform this long blighted area on Cesar Chavez into an active community space and dog park, and a big thanks to Dynamo Donuts and Charlie's Cafe for the refreshments and to neighbors Philip and Daniel for the live music.

In the last week we gained 2 new volunteers to help us launch a social media presence and an e-newsletter! We are still looking for a graphic designer, block captains, event hosts, and fundraisers. If anyone has skills or interest in helping in any of these capacities, please be in touch. This effort has been and will continue to be 100% neighbor-fueled, so thank you in advance for throwing in with us to bring this park to life.

Stay tuned for updates soon and meanwhile please connect us to friends and neighbors who werenâ€™t able to join us last weekend, but might be interested to be involved.

And happy holiday weekend! We hope everyone is enjoying this sublime weather.

Cheers!
Peralta Hill Neighboring Group
