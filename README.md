## How to add a new post

1. Create a new .markdown or .html file inside of the _posts directory, following the naming convention “yyyy-mm-dd-title”.
2. Write contents following the kickoff post as an example.
3. To include an image gallery, create a new directory under assets/images and set `gallery_path` in the post frontmatter to the new folder name.
  * Make sure there’s a thumbnail for each image, which should have the same file name as the full-size image but with a “-thumb.jpeg” suffix.
5. Commit and push those changes to GitHub. This will trigger a new deployment and update the site within a few minutes.
